I am a relentless purser of a knowledge and seek to find my path on this planet. I value family, community, friendships, spirituality and aim to use my knowledge in web development to enhance the lives of others.

This blogs aim is to be unfiltered and will be a place where I can share my failures and my success without the fear of judgment from others. The topics will vary from tech to life in general.

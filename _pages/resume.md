#### Data Curation Experts, Minneapolis, MN
##### Partner and Senior Developer

<small>JANUARY2017 - Present</small>


I work with clients to build large scale data repositories. This covers all aspects of project planning and delivery, including:

* Design and scoping
* Planning and delivery estimation
* System sizing and architecture
* Staff training and development
* Software development including coaching in development best   practices
* DevOps development including coaching for local systems staff
* Agile software development methodology and team coaching

#### Stanford University Library, Stanford, CA
##### Manager, Application Development, Digital Library Systems and Services

<small>APRIL 2011 - JANUARY 2017</small>


I managed thirteen developers and a project portfolio including discovery indexing, Library Systems, DevOps, GIS, and linked data.

Discovery indexing includes indexing the contents of our ILS and the contents of our Fedora digital library into Solr for discovery in SearchWorks, our Blacklight-based discovery solution. We use solrmarc, an open-source project I helped to establish in 2006, to index marc records. We use an internal workflow involving the Mods::Record and Stanford::Mods::Record ruby gems, both of which I have contributed to, to index mods records from our repository and other campus collections such as the Cantor Art Museum.

Library Systems includes the running of our SirsiDynix ILS and associated business operations. This includes our SFX link resolver and providing support to the library technical services departments.

DevOps is responsible for establishing and maintaining best practices for the software we develop and the systems we run in production. This includes deployment procedures (capistrano), system configuration management (puppet), and site reliability (nagios and pager duty).

GIS includes data workflow and cataloging for Stanford GIS content, migrating it from DVDs and external hard drives into the Stanford Digital Repository. We deliver the data via the Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure, making it available online to researchers instead of requiring them to come fetch it physically from the library. We index our GIS collections into SearchWorks and EarthWorks, a GeoBlacklight-based discovery system built specifically for finding GIS data. We also index GIS collections from other institutions into EarthWorks, with a goal of making data discovery as easy and comprehensive as possible for Stanford researchers.

We plan to transition many of our systems to use linked data instead of marc or XML, and we are currently conducting experiments and pilot projects with that aim in mind. I lead a linked data study group to help staff learn the linked data skills they’ll need, and plan our work for the Mellon-funded Linked Data for Production grant we are part of.

In addition to my core portfolio duties, I also act as a community organizer for the Hydra project, develop grant applications, form part of the management team for a large digital library department, organize conferences, and perform professional service in the form of public talks, publishing, and serving on the advisory board for the Digital Library Federation.

#### Stanford University Library, Stanford, CA
##### Senior Java Developer

<small>JANUARY 2010 - APRIL 2011</small>


As part of a team, I wrote software to build the Stanford Digital Repository. I was brought into this project because it was two years behind schedule, but I had a reputation for getting difficult projects accomplished. Through effective project management and modern software development techniques like test driven development we got the project back on track, and it now forms a core part of Stanford’s digital library infrastructure.

#### University of Virginia Library, Charlottesville, VA
##### Chief Architect of the Online Library Environment

<small>JANUARY 2009 – JANUARY 2010</small>


I led a team of five in the development and delivery of Blacklight at UVA, dramatically improving the library’s discovery experience. I contributed to the nascent Hydra project and implemented early Hydra efforts at UVA. I established improved production systems and procedures for the library’s repository infrastructure, resulting in smoother, more frequent releases of new features, and increased stability of our running services.

#### University of Virginia Library, Charlottesville, VA
##### Research and Development Librarian, Scholars’ Lab

<small>JULY 2005 – JANUARY 2009</small>


I led a team of three developers in creating software to support faculty research needs. I designed and built sophisticated data modeling and exploration systems, including spatial and textual analysis systems. I introduced many industry best practices to the library’s IT culture, such as test driven development, continuous integration, and code sprints. I co-founded Project Blacklight, which became the discovery system for UVA. I established monitoring and upgrade schedules for our digital library, resulting in dramatically improved reliability.

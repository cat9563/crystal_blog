I build digital libraries. I believe that open source is a superior software development methodology and that free software is a superior choice intellectually and morally. I believe that the long term challenges facing academic libraries can only be solved collaboratively. My objectives are to provide better discovery experiences for libraries, to find ways to effectively manage the huge amounts of digital content libraries are grappling with, and to do as much of this work as possible within a framework of community development, so the benefits extend as widely as possible.

I am a co-founder of and contributor to the free and open source software projects [Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Samvera](https://samvera.org/){:target="_blank"}, and most of my professional work happens in those communities. Currently, I work as a Senior Software Developer at [Data Curation Experts](https://curationexperts.com/){:target="_blank"}. Opinions expressed in this blog are my own.

MY MOTTO: SOLVITUR AMBULANDO
[“Solvitur Ambulando”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvitur_ambulando){:target="_blank"} literally translated means “it is solved by walking.” Generally, it is interpreted as “the problem is solved by a practical experiment” or else “learn by experience.” That’s how I tend to work and how I tend to learn. Origin: “Diogenes of Sinope, also known as “Diogenes the Cynic,” is said to have replied to the argument that motion is unreal by standing up and walking away.

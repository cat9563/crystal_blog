## Solar Vortex at UCSD

I was lucky enough to travel to UC San Diego last week for the [Samvera community’s Solar Vortex developer congress.](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Developer+Congress+-+Solar+Vortex+-+January+2020){:target="_blank"} The primary goal of the event was to move work forward on transitioning Hyrax to being able to use [Valkyrie](https://github.com/samvera/valkyrie){:target="_blank"} under the hood. I had an ulterior motive of ensuring my own understanding of Valkyrie was solid enough to be able to undertake a big project with it next month.

After months of hearing about Valkyrie and feeling a little frightened of it — after all, I’ve spent years at this point really getting my head around ActiveFedora / ActiveRecord patterns, and now we’re switching things up — I am very happy to report is isn’t as scary in person. [Lynette Rayle](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/r/Rayle:Lynette){:target="_blank"} had written a first draft of a [Dive Into Valkyrie](https://github.com/samvera/valkyrie/wiki/Dive-into-Valkyrie){:target="_blank"} tutorial, and I got to join a team of folks who were working on polishing it.

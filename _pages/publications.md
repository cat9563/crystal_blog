### THE CODE4LIB JOURNAL â€“ FEMINISM AND THE FUTURE OF LIBRARY DISCOVERY
[To Read Online](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10425?fbclid=IwAR3e0Odcl2cggjvgOYhTWYvGDYrdUdYZZNPqjHPxBMwGrUOYICGidZ8GLxI){:target="_blank"} 

This paper discusses the various ways in which the practices of libraries and librarians influence the diversity (or lack thereof) of scholarship and information access. We examine some of the cultural biases inherent in both library classification systems and newer forms of information access like Google search algorithms and propose ways of recognizing bias and applying feminist principles in the design of information services for scholars, particularly as libraries re-invent themselves to grapple with digital collections.

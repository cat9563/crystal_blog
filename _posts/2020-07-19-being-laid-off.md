## Shock 
I was recently laid off. Wow, that is so hard to say. I was recently laid off. Yeah that’s right.  The first thing that came to my mind were thoughts of trying to find my inner positive self-talk. This strategy wasn’t going to work for me and it’s not for an obvious reason. My self talk was gone and the thoughts didn’t come to me. 

You see it’s hard to give yourself good pep talk when you fail to realize that your ability  to do that has long left the building. Let me start from the top so you can follow my journey. Sit back my friend and enjoy my wibbly wobbly thoughts as I reminisce about the journey that has led me to this place of wonder. 

I started my journey in programming back in 2017! I was so excited! I just got my first opportunity to learn about programming. Wow! I am in this, I was accepted, this was my chance to make the changes I wanted so badly for myself and for my life journey. I started making my way with learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails. This was probably the start of my worst mistake. This is where the self sabotage began.

## Sabotage 
I didn’t know that I was going down a path of self doubt, fear, anxiety, and frustration. There is something people don’t tell you right away. You see in programming we make mistakes and we make them a lot over and over again. We are gluttons for punishment. We are not afraid of failure. Right? Sure that sounds right? Sounds good to me, I think. 

NO! That is completely shit! The answers aren’t ever that clear; they are never that easy. I am understating this! Programing is fucking hard!! 

I started to self doubt because I wasn’t prepared for the failure. One thing I did have going for me is that I am persistent. I will try, try, and try again. However, there is something I didn’t have going for me and that something was that I was ignorant. I tried to grasp documents quickly and I found myself skimming through doc’s and trying to write code at the speed of a senior programmer. 

That was me at month 2 of this journey. I thought to myself you know what I need to do! I need to start my journey on another bootcamp that will surely solve my problems. I had problems of pure self hatred for not having the ability to write code and have everything memorized (Insert sarcastic tone here) . 

Well guess what I made it to bootcamp. I was accepted but you see  the problem was I also got in with a grant. I was feeling pretty special. On the outside everyone was seeing a hard charging programmer who was eager to learn. They failed to see the self doubting, double guessing piece of work I was. I wasn’t even able to see it. The seed was still growing. 

Meanwhile, the red alerts to my shit code were growing at an alarming rate. You see I was rushing the process and thinking I can cram a ton of information in my head all at once. The stress was building up, the late nights of relentless effort led to me writing code until my eyes would dry up. I would have crying spells. All this writing I was doing and frustration I was having was because I was lacking to read the dam doc’s. I wanted to just fly without a damn GPS. 

## Self talk continues to Demolish and Shell Shock begins to Arise

I would try over, and over, and over, and over again. I was thinking something will surely work. 

* NO self-care 
* NO sleep
* NON stop coding

I was attempting to emerge in a world I didn’t understand.

This was going to lead to burnout and I didn’t know when to stop myself. The frustration I began to feel was with having thoughts like, “Why am I still not getting it!”.  I didn’t realize I was literally living as Einstein’s definition of insanity. I was trying the same thing over and over again and expecting to see different results. Sure, I was learning but in a very unnecessary frustrating way.

At this time in my life, “Imposter Syndrome” was beginning to have its way with me. I felt like a fraud. Everyone in my path sees a transgender, veteran, war hero! I am the only one who could see my inner turmoil. My fear of failure has grown so large. Push, push, push, push, push, try hard, try harder!  Why isn’t this working! 

I graduated bootcamp! I got a job at IBM but holy crap how the freak did I pull that off. I got a job in something called Cloud Ops some people call it Devops and for the really fancy people of “Title Ville” they call it Site Reliability Engineer. I seriously didn’t know what I got myself into. I took a job I was not qualified for and then I found myself having to learn a shit ton of complex systems. Systems such as: Linux, Ansibile, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins all of that stuff.

I ended up just working on the boring stuff. I got pulled into the ops world and the absolute lack of creativity there killed my soul. RIP Crystal Zoe Ramirez you have now turned gray and blue. You are a drone now, a zombie, just some hamster clicking on buttons. Then the pandemic happened! Then the layoff happened!

## Back to the Present
I was delivered the, “bad news” and told I was being dropped off on the corner with a backpack and a few things for survival, “good luck out there kid.” and like that IBM was gone and out of my life. I was trying to find my positive self talk but unable to find it, because I left it all back with that awesome soul who was brave enough to start this journey in the first place. I was no longer her and I had become someone else. 

The self talk was gone and so was my love for life and my curiosity for tech at least so it seemed.

## Grieving 
I couldn’t find my inner voice. We lost contact a long time ago. I couldn’t hear her through my anxiety which had grown so immense in the place of my positive-self. I found anxiety is all that was left. Snap, break,  crumble the thoughts are no longer able to connect and the synapse of neurons have now snapped. Stress is my lord now. 

I was no longer able to concentrate on my journey and part of me felt like it had died. I am so thankful that our souls have the power to regenerate because this is the part of the story where the hero accepts her mistakes and comes away from this stronger. 

At some point in all of the inner turmoil, stress, and anxiety. I was able to see a way through this. I had to let go of the person I had become and return to the person I always was. I had to be brave enough to find my true passions. I didn’t suck at my job. I sucked at taking the time to do things right, to read things through, and to ask better questions. I wanted to let go of my fear of success. Success gives one more things to lose at least that is how I saw it. When fear becomes your god it’s hard to see it any other way.

However, there is another way. It’s called forgiveness. I had to forgive myself for failure. Believe me the prayers started but that’s another topic for a different day. Yes, the higher powers were going to hear from me. I had a lot of apologies to make. I mostly had to apologize for not loving myself. I had to see my positives and accept them as truths. 

I am so sorry self you aren’t so bad please just start reading the damn doc’s.
